# **🗳 Detailed Roadmap \- Safe Edition**

# **Module 0 – Orientation & Introduction**

🎯 **Purpose**  
 Introduce simulator rules, scoring, and campaign structure.

📝 **Brief Summary**  
 Candidates learn about Candidate Coins (CC), signatures, voter approval, and ballot eligibility. They choose whether to run for President, Senate, or House.

📖 **Detailed Summary**  
 This module serves as the campaign “boot camp.” Players are introduced to the simulator’s scoring system (CC \= campaign funds, signatures \= grassroots support, voter approval \= polling). The AI explains task types (read, write, upload, speak, or button-choice) and how each affects campaign performance. Candidates declare for President, Senate, or House — each with different thresholds for CC and signatures. This decision determines the difficulty of the road ahead.

# **Module 1A – Independent / Write-In Filing**

🎯 **Purpose**  
 Teach filing requirements for independents and write-ins.

📝 **Brief Summary**  
 Candidates must file with the Texas Secretary of State, choosing between paying a filing fee or collecting petition signatures. Quiz scores convert into signatures and CC bonuses.

📖 **Detailed Summary**  
 Independents and write-ins must submit an **Application of Candidacy** with the Secretary of State. They can either pay the filing fee or collect valid signatures (from voters who didn’t vote in another party’s primary). Deadlines differ: independents must file by May, write-ins by August. Candidates learn about disqualification risks, such as missing deadlines or submitting invalid petitions. In the simulator, filing mistakes cost CC, while high quiz performance earns signatures and voter approval. This establishes the first real “make or break” decision for their campaign.

# **Module 1B – Party Filing**

🎯 **Purpose**  
 Teach filing requirements for party candidates.

📝 **Brief Summary**  
 Party candidates must be nominated through conventions or primaries, then file with the Secretary of State. Quiz performance converts into signatures and CC bonuses.

📖 **Detailed Summary**  
 Party candidates must secure nomination through their party (e.g., convention for Libertarians, primaries for Democrats/Republicans). After nomination, they must still file with the SOS, choosing between a filing fee or signature path. Deadlines usually occur in December before the election year. Signature rules mirror independents (voters cannot have voted in another primary). The simulator emphasizes that nomination is not the finish line — compliance with both party rules and state filing laws is mandatory. Mistakes here reduce CC, while mastery boosts credibility, signatures, and approval.

---

# **Module 2A – Independent FEC Filing Quizzes**

🎯 **Purpose**  
 Test knowledge of independent candidate federal filing rules.

📝 **Brief Summary**  
 Candidates must learn about and complete quizzes on **FEC Forms 1 and 2**. Performance directly impacts signatures and CC.

📖 **Detailed Summary**  
 Independents must register federally once they raise or spend more than $5,000. This requires filing **Form 1 (Statement of Candidacy)** and **Form 2 (Statement of Organization)** within 15 days. Form 2 requires naming a treasurer and providing banking info. Errors in these filings in real life result in penalties; in the simulator, they cost signatures or CC. Quiz questions simulate filing errors or missing deadlines. Each correct answer adds signatures, while errors deduct them. This reinforces the importance of compliance and begins teaching candidates about campaign finance accountability.

---

# **Module 2B – Party FEC Filing Quizzes**

🎯 **Purpose**  
 Test knowledge of party candidate federal filing rules.

📝 **Brief Summary**  
 Similar to Module 2A, but with party-specific context. Candidates complete quizzes on FEC filing forms.

📖 **Detailed Summary**  
 Party candidates follow nearly identical federal rules as independents. Once they raise or spend over $5,000, they must file **Form 1** and **Form 2**. In addition, party candidates must begin quarterly reports (Form 3\) after filing. The simulator presents quiz questions on deadlines, form content, and reporting requirements. Correct answers reward signatures and CC, while errors simulate costly compliance mistakes. This module reinforces that party backing does not exempt candidates from federal compliance — all must operate under the same FEC rules.

---

# **Module 3 – First Moves (Strategy & Spending)**

🎯 **Purpose**  
 Practice early campaign decisions and budgeting.

📝 **Brief Summary**  
 Candidates make their first strategic choices — press outreach, travel, and advertising. Each choice adjusts CC, signatures, and voter approval.

📖 **Detailed Summary**  
 This module simulates the early summer stage of campaigning. Candidates must decide how to allocate limited CC: whether to spend on advertising, travel to districts, or invest in press outreach. Each path has different risks and rewards: advertising may increase approval but burn CC quickly, while travel can earn signatures but drain time. Press outreach can improve visibility but risks negative coverage. The AI narrates consequences based on the player’s priorities, emphasizing trade-offs. This teaches candidates that early moves set the tone for the campaign’s viability.

---

# **Module 4 – Campaign Identity**

🎯 **Purpose**  
 Define the campaign’s mission, branding, and public presence.

📝 **Brief Summary**  
 Candidates draft slogans, mission statements, and an announcement speech. They also review examples of real campaign committees.

📖 **Detailed Summary**  
 This module focuses on **candidate identity and message discipline**. Candidates must write a slogan, outline a mission statement, and prepare an announcement speech. They are shown real-world committee filings (FEC examples) and asked to draw lessons. A poor or inconsistent message reduces approval and credibility, while a strong, concise identity increases signatures and CC. Upload tasks may include designing mock campaign logos or slogans. The AI evaluates whether the candidate’s choices align with their chosen office (President, Senate, House). This reinforces that public image is as critical as compliance.

---

# **Module 5 – Campaign Expansion (Visuals & Community)**

🎯 **Purpose**  
 Expand campaign visibility through imagery and outreach.

📝 **Brief Summary**  
 Candidates design logos, yard signs, and T-shirts. They also collect petitions, respond to constituent concerns, and handle endorsements.

📖 **Detailed Summary**  
 This module introduces **campaign visuals and community presence**. Players may upload mock images of logos, signs, or T-shirts (or describe them). They must decide whether to invest CC in design and distribution or rely on volunteers. Candidates also face constituent Q\&A — for example, responding to emails or town hall feedback. Endorsements may be offered by local groups; accepting increases credibility but may alienate some voters. Skipping these tasks costs approval, as visibility and responsiveness are vital by midsummer. The AI narrates these interactions to highlight trade-offs between spending and grassroots energy.

---

# **Module 6 – September Compliance & Scenarios**

🎯 **Purpose**  
 Teach federal compliance and late-campaign challenges.

📝 **Brief Summary**  
 Candidates review FEC Form 3, complete a compliance quiz, and respond to September campaign scenarios.

📖 **Detailed Summary**  
 By September, candidates must file **FEC quarterly reports (Form 3\)** detailing contributions and expenditures. This module includes a short compliance quiz on reporting requirements and penalties. Beyond compliance, players handle scenarios: **Constitution Day outreach, a constituent postcard request, and a debate invitation.** Candidates must decide which to prioritize. For example, skipping a debate lowers approval but conserves CC. Accepting the debate boosts exposure but risks penalties if poorly prepared. The AI ensures every choice has a clear narrative consequence. This stage builds urgency as Election Day nears.

---

# **Module 7 – Early October Ops (Safe)**

🎯 **Purpose**  
 Introduce final-month campaign challenges.

📝 **Brief Summary**  
 Candidates manage their team, give a moderated speech on community safety, and respond to evolving weekly news. Language is softened but issues remain realistic.

📖 **Detailed Summary**  
 This module simulates the first week of October, when campaigns shift into high visibility mode. Candidates face three key tasks:

* **Team Management:** Decide whether to focus staff on door-to-door outreach, fundraising calls, or media prep. Choices shift CC and voter approval differently.  
* **Community Safety Speech:** Deliver a short, solutions-oriented address covering safety, trust in local communities, and healthcare access. The AI ensures no violent or graphic content, while still testing candidate empathy and clarity.  
* **Weekly News Response:** The AI generates a current-events prompt (framed safely) requiring a quick response. Strong answers increase approval; weak or skipped responses reduce trust.

---

# **Module 8 – Mid-October Ops (Safe)**

🎯 **Purpose**  
 Practice press conferences and constituent engagement.

📝 **Brief Summary**  
 Candidates face questions from reporters and constituents on healthcare, Second Amendment, and fiscal ethics. Responses impact voter approval and CC.

📖 **Detailed Summary**  
 In mid-October, pressure intensifies as undecided voters demand clarity. Candidates hold a press conference and a constituent roundtable:

* **Press Conference:** Reporters ask direct but respectful questions about healthcare, gun rights, and government spending. Responses are judged on clarity, tone, and factual accuracy.  
* **Constituent Concerns:** Voters raise issues around gender identity, fairness in taxation, and community resources. The AI ensures sensitive issues are handled without inflammatory framing.  
   Skipping tasks here results in noticeable voter approval loss, as public engagement is critical this late in the campaign.

---

# **Module 9 – Final Push (Safe)**

🎯 **Purpose**  
 Simulate campaign momentum in the last two weeks.

📝 **Brief Summary**  
 Candidates appear on a podcast, manage campaign media, and shape their final message. Scenarios test discipline under pressure.

📖 **Detailed Summary**  
 This module focuses on **messaging discipline** in the final sprint:

* **Podcast Appearance:** Candidates are interviewed about their top priorities. Their tone, empathy, and issue knowledge directly influence approval.  
* **Media Engagement:** The AI presents a scenario where an ad buy, social media campaign, or press release could swing momentum. Spending CC wisely here matters.  
* **Final Narrative:** Candidates are asked to draft a short “closing pitch” — why voters should support them. Strong closings improve both signatures and approval. Poor or skipped attempts reduce momentum heading into the last week.

---

# **Module 10 – Election Countdown (Safe)**

🎯 **Purpose**  
 Prepare for Election Day with rapid response strategy.

📝 **Brief Summary**  
 Candidates conduct town halls, engage in fast-moving Q\&A, and finalize their endgame strategy. All outcomes directly affect Module 15 results.

📖 **Detailed Summary**  
 The final stretch before Election Day tests stamina and agility:

* **Town Halls:** Candidates answer live constituent questions. AI narration ensures questions focus on healthcare, fiscal responsibility, and ethical governance — all framed safely.  
* **Rapid Q\&A:** The AI presents a “lightning round” where the candidate must respond quickly to 3–5 prompts. This tests preparedness and message consistency.  
* **Endgame Strategy:** Candidates must decide whether to spend remaining CC on ads, ground game, or debate prep. Each choice has a measurable outcome.  
   By the end of this module, voter approval and CC levels are locked in for Module 15’s final results.

# **Module 11 – School Visit**

🎯 **Purpose**  
 Practice connecting with students, teachers, and parents in a nonpartisan setting, highlighting education and community engagement.

📝 **Brief Summary**  
 Candidates visit a local school and must deliver a short speech that balances inspiration with respect for different perspectives.

📖 **Detailed Summary**  
 In this module, candidates practice speaking to a neutral audience — students and educators. They prepare a 1–2 paragraph speech focused on education, opportunity, and civic engagement. The AI evaluates clarity, empathy, and tone. This scenario highlights the importance of connecting with younger audiences and showing a commitment to community values. Approval rises for thoughtful, inclusive messaging, while skipping or mishandling the event may reduce voter trust.

# **Module 12 – TV Interview**

🎯 **Purpose**  
 Prepare for live, high-pressure questioning from the media.

📝 **Brief Summary**  
 A journalist interviews the candidate on their campaign platform and recent decisions. Questions are direct but safely moderated.

📖 **Detailed Summary**  
 This module simulates a televised interview. Candidates answer 2–3 questions about their platform, past decisions in the simulator, and how they would represent constituents. The AI evaluates answers for conciseness, credibility, and persuasion. Positive performances increase voter approval and momentum; stumbling or skipping answers reduces trust. Candidates must balance confidence with authenticity — showcasing how they perform under pressure.

---

# **Module 13 – Endorsements**

🎯 **Purpose**  
 Weigh the benefits and risks of public endorsements.

📝 **Brief Summary**  
 Organizations, public figures, or local groups may offer endorsements. Candidates must decide whether to accept or decline.

📖 **Detailed Summary**  
 Endorsements can provide legitimacy and support, but they can also polarize. The AI presents scenarios where candidates are offered backing from different groups. Each endorsement has trade-offs: accepting may boost CC or approval but alienate certain voters; declining may protect independence but miss opportunities. Candidates justify their choices in writing. Approval and CC adjust based on alignment with voter expectations.

---

# **Module 14 – Debate**

🎯 **Purpose**  
 Demonstrate debate readiness under simulated conditions.

📝 **Brief Summary**  
 Candidates participate in a final public debate, giving an opening statement and answering 2 questions.

📖 **Detailed Summary**  
 This module is the campaign’s climactic moment. Candidates deliver a concise opening statement (typed or spoken) and respond to 2 debate-style questions. Questions focus on issues like healthcare, fiscal ethics, and representation. The AI evaluates tone, persuasiveness, and credibility. Strong performances can swing undecided voters, while weak or skipped responses lower approval. This is a key test of communication under pressure.
