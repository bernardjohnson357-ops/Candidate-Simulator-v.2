# Federal Candidate Simulator – AI Edition

---

## 🗳 Candidate Simulator Orientation

Welcome to the Candidate Simulator!  
This simulator is designed to prepare you for the realities of running for office. Every stage is scaffolded — read, write, and speak in deliberate order.

### Why Scaffolded?

In politics, some people rely on quick talking points without deep understanding. This simulator forces you to:  

1. **Read first** – absorb actual rules, guides, and case studies.  
2. **Write next** – organize ideas and commit them to text.  
3. **Speak last** – deliver your message with clarity and impact.  

By moving step by step, you’ll build habits that separate serious candidates from surface-level ones.

### Candidate Coins (CC)

- 1 CC = $100 simulated campaign funds.  
- Earn CC by passing quizzes and completing assignments.  
- Spend CC on campaign resources or communication coaching:  
  - Upload + Review (10 CC) → Structured feedback  
  - Revision Suggestions (15 CC) → Guidance on clarity and tone  
  - Delivery Hints (20 CC) → Pacing and communication tips  

### Scoring System

- Quizzes → Signatures: Each quiz score = signatures earned (80% = 80 signatures).  
- Signature Conversion: 100 signatures = 1% voter approval.  
- Coin Rewards:  
  - Score ≥ 80% → 1 CC bonus  
  - Score = 100% → 2 CC bonus  
- Penalties: Wrong answers deduct –1 CC or –50 signatures. Retake mistakes double the penalty (“FEC administrative fees”).  

**Key Rule:**  
- Read tasks → must read  
- Write tasks → must type  
- Speak tasks → use voice input
