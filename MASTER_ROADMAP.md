# Federal Candidate Simulator – Master Roadmap  
**AI Edition**  

---

## Module 0 – Introduction  

### 🎯 Purpose  
The Candidate Simulator teaches prospective federal candidates—especially independents and third-party hopefuls—how to run a campaign safely and realistically.  

It combines:  
- **Real-World Processes**: Laws, FEC filing requirements, ballot access, and official guides.  
- **Simulation Mechanics**: Candidate Coins (CC), quizzes, voter signatures, and scenario-based decision-making.  

By the end, participants understand both what real candidates must do and how to practice these steps in a simulation.  

### 🏛️ The Real Candidate Process  
Running for federal office in the U.S. involves:  
1. Choosing an Office: President, U.S. Senate, or U.S. House.  
2. Meeting Ballot Requirements: Paying fees or gathering signatures.  
3. FEC Reporting: Filing Forms 1 & 2 at the start, and quarterly Form 3 filings once campaign activity crosses financial thresholds.  
4. Building Voter Support: Developing a campaign identity and gaining approval.  

### 🎮 How the Simulator Works  
- Each participant starts with **50 Candidate Coins (CC)**.  
- Choose a ballot access path: Independent, Third-Party, or Write-In.  
- Your choice determines your simulator branch.  

**Candidate Coin (CC) System**  
- 1 CC = $100 (simulated).  
- Quizzes simulate fundraising: correct answers earn CC and signatures.  

**Signatures → Voter Approval**  
- 1 signature = 0.0001 voter approval.  
- Example: 100 signatures = 1% approval; 1,000 signatures = 10% approval.  

**Eligibility for the General Election**  
- **Fee Option (pay CC + minimum approval)**:  
  - President: 75 CC + 2.5% approval  
  - Senate: 50 CC + 2.5% approval  
  - House: 31 CC + 2.5% approval  
- **Signature Option (no fee)**:  
  - President: 25% nationwide  
  - Senate: 14% statewide  
  - House: 7% districtwide  

**Quizzes & Retakes**  
- 1 free retake for all quizzes.  
- Wrong answers = penalties: –1 CC or –50 signatures.  
- Retake mistakes double the penalty (“FEC administrative fees”).
