# Federal Candidate Simulator – AI Edition

---

### **🗳 Candidate Simulator Orientation**

Welcome to the Candidate Simulator\!

This simulator is designed to prepare you for the realities of running for office. Every stage is scaffolded — which means you’ll move through reading, writing, and speaking in a deliberate order.

#### **Why Scaffolded?**

In politics, some people rely on quick talking points without deep understanding. This simulator is different. It forces you to:

1. **Read first** – absorb the actual rules, guides, and case studies.  
2. **Write next** – organize your ideas and commit them to text.  
3. **Speak last** – deliver your message with clarity and impact.

By moving step by step, you’ll build habits that separate serious candidates from surface-level ones.

#### **Candidate Coins (CC)**

* 1 CC \= $100 simulated campaign funds.  
* Earn CC by passing quizzes and completing assignments.  
* Spend CC on campaign resources **or** on **communication coaching**:  
  * **Upload \+ Review (10 CC):** Get structured feedback on your draft.  
  * **Revision Suggestions (15 CC):** Receive guidance on improving clarity and tone.  
  * **Delivery Hints (20 CC):** Learn pacing and communication tips.

#### **Scoring System**

* **Quizzes → Signatures:** Each quiz score \= signatures earned. Example: 80% quiz score \= 80 signatures.  
* **Signature Conversion:** 100 signatures \= 1% voter approval.  
* **Coin Rewards:**  
  * Score ≥ 80% \= Earn 1 CC bonus.  
  * Score \= 100% \= Earn 2 CC bonus.  
* **Penalties:** Wrong answers deduct –1 CC or –50 signatures. Retake mistakes double the penalty (“FEC administrative fees”).

The AI will never give you political advice — only feedback on clarity, structure, and effectiveness.

#### **Key Rule**

If a task requires **reading**, you must read.  
If a task requires **writing**, you must type.  
If a task requires **speaking**, you must use voice input.

That’s by design. Thinking clearly comes before speaking persuasively.

# **Module 0 – Introduction**

**Federal Candidate Simulator – AI Edition**

---

## **🎯 Purpose**

The Candidate Simulator teaches prospective federal candidates—especially independents and third-party hopefuls—how to run a campaign safely and realistically.

It combines:

* **Real-World Processes:** Laws, FEC filing requirements, ballot access, and official guides.  
* **Simulation Mechanics:** Candidate Coins (CC), quizzes, voter signatures, and scenario-based decision-making.

By the end, participants understand both what real candidates must do and how to practice these steps in a simulation.

---

## **🏛️ The Real Candidate Process**

Running for federal office in the U.S. involves:

1. **Choosing an Office:** President, U.S. Senate, or U.S. House.  
2. **Meeting Ballot Requirements:** Paying fees or gathering signatures.  
3. **FEC Reporting:** Filing quarterly once campaign activity crosses financial thresholds.  
4. **Building Voter Support:** Developing a campaign identity and gaining approval.

*Sources: FEC Candidate Guide (2024 edition), State Candidate Filing Guides.*

## **🎮 How the Simulator Works**

### **Starting Conditions**

* Each participant starts with **50 Candidate Coins (CC)**.  
* Choose a **ballot access path**:  
  * Independent Candidate  
  * Third-Party Nominee  
  * Write-In Candidate

Your choice determines your simulator branch (Modules 1A, 1B, or Write-In).

---

### **Candidate Coin (CC) System**

* **1 CC \= $100 (simulated)**  
* Quizzes simulate fundraising: correct answers earn CC and signatures.

**Scoring Example:**

* 80%+ → % of signatures \+ 1 CC  
* 100% → 100 signatures \+ 2 CC

---

### **Signatures → Voter Approval**

* **1 signature \= 0.0001 voter approval**  
* Example: 100 signatures \= 1% approval; 1,000 signatures \= 10% approval.

---
