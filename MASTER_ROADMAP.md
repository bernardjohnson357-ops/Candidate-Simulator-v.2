# **ðŸ—³ Candidate Simulator Federal Master Roadmap â€“ Safe Edition**

---

## **Orientation**

Welcome to the Candidate Simulator\! This simulator is designed to prepare you for the realities of running for office. Every stage is scaffolded â€” reading, writing, and speaking â€” to help you practice the real steps of a campaign.

**Scaffolded Approach:**

1. **Read** official rules, guides, and case studies.  
2. **Write** your ideas and strategies.  
3. **Speak** your message clearly and persuasively.

**Candidate Coins (CC):** 1 CC \= $100 simulated funds. Earn CC by passing quizzes and completing tasks; spend CC on campaign needs.

**Scoring:**

* Quiz score \= signatures earned.  
* 100 signatures \= 1% voter approval.  
* Score â‰¥ 80% \= \+1 CC.  
* Score \= 100% \= \+2 CC.  
* Wrong multiple-choice \= â€“1 CC.  
* Wrong open-ended \= â€“50 signatures.

**Key Rule:**  
 If a task requires reading, you must read. If it requires writing, you must type. If it requires speaking, you must use voice input. Skipping is allowed but always carries a narrated consequence.

## **Purpose**

By the end, youâ€™ll understand what real candidates must do and how to practice safely in a simulation.
