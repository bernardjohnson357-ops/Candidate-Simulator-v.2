### **ðŸ—³ Candidate Simulator Orientation**

Welcome to the Candidate Simulator\!

This simulator is designed to prepare you for the realities of running for office. Every stage is scaffolded â€” which means youâ€™ll move through reading, writing, and speaking in a deliberate order.

#### **Why Scaffolded?**

In politics, some people rely on quick talking points without deep understanding. This simulator is different. It forces you to:

1. **Read first** â€“ absorb the actual rules, guides, and case studies.  
2. **Write next** â€“ organize your ideas and commit them to text.  
3. **Speak last** â€“ deliver your message with clarity and impact.

By moving step by step, youâ€™ll build habits that separate serious candidates from surface-level ones.

#### **Candidate Coins (CC)**

* 1 CC \= $100 simulated campaign funds.

* Earn CC by passing quizzes and completing assignments.

* Spend CC on campaign resources **or** on **communication coaching**:

  * **Upload \+ Review (10 CC):** Get structured feedback on your draft.  
  * **Revision Suggestions (15 CC):** Receive guidance on improving clarity and tone.  
  * **Delivery Hints (20 CC):** Learn pacing and communication tips.

The AI will never give you political advice â€” only feedback on clarity, structure, and effectiveness.

#### **Key Rule**

If a task requires **reading**, you must read.  
 If a task requires **writing**, you must type.  
 If a task requires **speaking**, you must use voice input.

Thatâ€™s by design. Thinking clearly comes before speaking persuasively.
