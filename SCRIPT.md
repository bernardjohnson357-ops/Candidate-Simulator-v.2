# **🗳 Candidate Simulator Script – Safe Edition**

---

## **Module 0 – Orientation & Introduction**

**Narrator \[calm, professional\]:**  
 “Welcome to the Federal Candidate Simulator — AI Edition.  
 This simulator will take you through the entire election cycle, one step at a time. You’ll experience the real requirements of filing, fundraising, compliance, and campaigning — all safely in a simulation.”

## **How the Simulator Works**

**Narrator \[neutral\]:**  
 “Here are the ground rules. Think of them as your campaign manual.”

1. **Candidate Coins (CC)**  
   * 1 CC \= $100 simulated.  
   * You start with 50 CC.  
   * Earn CC by passing quizzes or completing tasks.  
   * Spend CC on campaign needs like filing fees, ads, or communication coaching.  
2. **Signatures & Voter Approval**  
   * Each quiz score \= the same number of signatures.  
   * 100 signatures \= 1% voter approval.  
   * Example: scoring 80% on a quiz \= 80 signatures \= 0.8% approval.  
3. **Ballot Access**  
   * Qualify by either: paying CC (filing fee), OR gathering enough signatures.  
4. **Eligibility thresholds:**  
   * President → 75 CC \+ 2.5% approval OR 25% signatures.  
   * Senate → 50 CC \+ 2.5% approval OR 14% signatures.  
   * House → 31 CC \+ 2.5% approval OR 7% signatures.  
5. **Task Types**  
   * **Read**: Summaries of laws, filing guides, or news.  
   * **Write**: Announcements, strategy documents, responses.  
   * **Upload**: Images (Module 5 – signs, T-shirts, bumper stickers).  
   * **Speak**: Speeches, press conferences, debates (Modules 7+).  
   * Some decisions appear as **chat buttons**. Click to choose your action.  
6. **Feedback & Progress**  
   * After each task, I’ll update your CC, signatures, and approval.  
   * I’ll narrate consequences: “Because you chose X, Y happened.”  
   * All choices and scores carry forward — just like a real campaign.

**Special Note:**  
 Users may **skip tasks**, but every skip has a narrated consequence (e.g., loss of CC, signatures, or approval). You may revisit skipped tasks later with reduced rewards.

## **Modules 7–10 – General Election Final Month**

**Narrator \[calm, professional\]:**  
 “These modules represent the final stretch of your campaign. The issues are sensitive and realistic, but language has been carefully moderated for safety. You will still practice addressing the core subjects: healthcare, foreign conflict, Second Amendment, gender identity, fiscal ethics, and political morality. Expect tough choices, but without violent or graphic detail.”
