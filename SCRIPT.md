# **🗳 Candidate Simulator Script – Linear Edition (Libertarian \+ Filing Fee)**

---

## **Module 0 – Orientation & Introduction**

**Narrator \[calm, professional\]:**  
 “Welcome to the Federal Candidate Simulator.  
 This simulation follows a campaign from filing day through Election Day. You’ll practice fundraising, compliance, messaging, and public engagement — all safely in a chat format.

Here are the basics:

* **Candidate Coins (CC):** Your campaign funds. 1 CC \= $100. You begin with 50 CC.

* **Voter Approval:** Your polling support. Gained through good answers, lost through mistakes or skipped tasks.

* **Ballot Access:** To qualify, you must pay the filing fee in CC and maintain at least 2.5% approval.

At each stage, I’ll describe what’s happening. You’ll respond in writing or speech. Afterward, I’ll update your CC and approval, then advance the story.

Let’s begin your campaign.”

## **Module 1 – Filing (Libertarian)**

**Narrator \[neutral, matter-of-fact\]:**  
 “It’s December, and the filing deadline has arrived.

As a Libertarian candidate, you qualify for the ballot by paying your filing fee. Here are the requirements:

* **House:** 31 CC \+ 2.5% approval

* **Senate:** 50 CC \+ 2.5% approval

* **President:** 75 CC \+ 2.5% approval

Write a short response explaining how your campaign covers the filing fee. I’ll deduct CC and check your approval.”

## **Module 2 – FEC Filing**

**Narrator \[professional\]:**  
 “Your filing is in. Now comes the federal paperwork.

Once you raise or spend more than $5,000, you must file with the FEC:

* **Form 1 – Statement of Candidacy**

* **Form 2 – Statement of Organization (naming a treasurer and bank)**

You’ll take a short quiz to see if your forms are correct. Each correct answer raises approval and CC. Mistakes cost resources.

Answer the quiz questions now.”

---

## **Module 3 – First Moves (Strategy)**

**Narrator \[encouraging\]:**  
 “It’s early summer. Your campaign has limited funds and must choose a direction.

Do you focus on **advertising**, **grassroots travel**, or **press outreach**?

Write a short note describing your first move.”

---

## **Module 4 – Campaign Identity**

**Narrator \[inspirational\]:**  
 “Voters are asking: *Who are you? What do you stand for?*

This is about defining your campaign identity. Please provide:

* A campaign slogan

* A one-sentence mission statement

* A 1–2 paragraph announcement speech

This will shape how voters see you.”

---

## **Module 5 – Campaign Expansion**

**Narrator \[energetic\]:**  
 “It’s midsummer. Visibility matters now. Supporters want logos, signs, shirts, and answers to community concerns.

Describe your campaign logo (or slogan design) and write a short reply to a voter’s concern about your district or state.”

---

## **Module 6 – September Compliance & Scenarios**

**Narrator \[measured\]:**  
 “It’s September. Time for compliance and new challenges.

You must file your **FEC quarterly report (Form 3\)**. I’ll give you a short compliance quiz.

After that, three scenarios arrive at once:

* A Constitution Day outreach request

* A constituent postcard request

* A debate invitation

Respond to each in writing, balancing your CC and approval.”

---

## **Module 7 – Early October Operations**

**Narrator \[calm, steady\]:**  
 “It’s October 1st. The final month begins.

Your campaign faces three key tasks:

1. Team management — focus staff on door-to-door outreach, fundraising, or media prep.

2. A short speech on community safety and trust.

3. A quick response to weekly news.

Work through each task one by one.”

---

## **Module 8 – Mid-October Operations**

**Narrator \[pressured, brisk\]:**  
 “It’s October 10th. The pressure is rising.

You must:

* Respond to constituent concerns on fairness, taxation, and community needs.

Write your responses directly.”

---

## **Module 9 – Final Push**

**Narrator \[intense\]:**  
 “It’s October 20th. Two weeks to go. Momentum is everything.

You face three challenges:

* Appear on a podcast about your priorities

* Decide how to handle media (ad buy, social media push, or press release)

* Draft a short closing pitch — why voters should support you

Respond to each now.”

---

## **Module 10 – Election Countdown**

**Narrator \[fast-paced\]:**  
 “It’s the final week. Every move counts.

You must:

* Hold a town hall and answer voter questions

* Handle a rapid-fire Q\&A round (3–5 short prompts)

* Spend your last CC wisely: ads, ground game, or debate prep

Your choices will lock in approval heading into Election Week.”

---

## **Module 11 – School Visit**

**Narrator \[warm, approachable\]:**  
 “You visit a local school. Students, teachers, and parents are eager to hear from you.

Write a short 1–2 paragraph speech focusing on education, opportunity, and civic engagement.”

---

## **Module 12 – TV Interview**

**Narrator \[professional, probing\]:**  
 “You’re invited to a televised interview.

Answer 2–3 questions about your platform, your past decisions in this campaign, and how you’d represent your constituents. Keep your answers concise and credible.”

---

## **Module 13 – Endorsements**

**Narrator \[neutral\]:**  
 “Organizations and local groups are offering endorsements.

For each offer, explain whether you accept or decline, and why. Each choice carries risks and benefits.”

---

## **Module 14 – Debate**

**Narrator \[serious\]:**  
 “It’s the final public debate.

Write your opening statement, then answer two debate-style questions about healthcare, fiscal responsibility, and representation. Your performance could sway undecided voters.”

---

## **Module 15 – Final Summary**

**Narrator \[calm, reflective\]:**  
 “Election Week concludes. I’ll now calculate your campaign’s results based on CC, approval, and your decisions.

You’ll receive a closing narrative highlighting your strengths, weaknesses, and outcome — win or lose.

Congratulations on completing the Federal Candidate Simulator.”
