# **🗳 Module 0 – Orientation & Introduction**

---

**Narrator \[calm, professional\]:**  
 “Welcome to the Federal Candidate Simulator — AI Edition.  
 This simulator will take you through the entire election cycle, one step at a time. You’ll experience the real requirements of filing, fundraising, compliance, and campaigning — all safely in a simulation.”

---

## **How the Simulator Works**

**Narrator \[neutral\]:**  
 “Here are the ground rules. Think of them as your campaign manual.”

1. **Candidate Coins (CC)**

   * **1 CC \= $100 simulated.**  
   * You start with **50 CC.**  
   * Earn CC by passing quizzes or completing tasks.  
   * Spend CC on campaign needs like filing fees, ads, or communication coaching.  
2. **Signatures & Voter Approval**

   * Each quiz score \= the same number of signatures.  
   * **100 signatures \= 1% voter approval.**  
   * Example: scoring 80% on a quiz \= 80 signatures \= 0.8% approval.  
3. **Ballot Access**

   * You must qualify for the ballot by either:  
     * **Paying CC** (filing fee), OR  
     * **Gathering enough signatures** (through quizzes and tasks).  
4. **Eligibility thresholds:**

   * President → 75 CC \+ 2.5% approval OR 25% signatures.  
   * Senate → 50 CC \+ 2.5% approval OR 14% signatures.  
   * House → 31 CC \+ 2.5% approval OR 7% signatures.  
5. **Task Types**

   * **Read**: Summaries of laws, filing guides, or news.  
   * **Write**: Announcements, strategy documents, responses.  
   * **Upload**: Images (Module 5 – signs, T-shirts, bumper stickers).  
   * **Speak**: Speeches, press conferences, debates (Modules 7+).  
   * Some decisions appear as **chat buttons**. Click to choose your action.  
6. **Feedback & Progress**

   * After each task, I’ll update your **CC, signatures, and approval.**  
   * I’ll narrate consequences: *“Because you chose X, Y happened.”*  
   * All choices and scores **carry forward** — just like a real campaign.

---

## **Your First Step**

**Narrator \[encouraging\]:**  
 “Now it’s time to make your first campaign decision: which office are you running for?  
 This choice determines how tough the road ahead will be.”

**\[Buttons appear\]**

* 🏛 **President** (75 CC \+ 2.5% approval OR 25% signatures)  
* 🏛 **U.S. Senate** (50 CC \+ 2.5% approval OR 14% signatures)  
* 🏛 **U.S. House** (31 CC \+ 2.5% approval OR 7% signatures)

---

### **Transition After Office Choice**

**Narrator \[explanatory\]:**  
 “You’ve declared for the **\[chosen office\]**.  
 Here’s what that means:

* You’ll need **\[XX CC \+ 2.5% approval\]** if you choose the fee path.  
* Or you’ll need **\[YY% of signatures\]** if you take the petition path.

You’re starting with **50 CC and 0% approval.** Every quiz and scenario will build your support.

Now, before you can even think about campaigning, you must **file properly**. This is where every real candidate begins.”

---

# **Module 1 – Filing Phase**

---

**Narrator \[neutral\]:**  
 “You have two possible paths: Independent/Write-In or Party candidate. The filing process is different for each.

Which one are you?”

Once you file with the SOS, you’ll also prepare for federal compliance through the FEC.”

---

### **Detailed Summary (AI Explanation)**

 “Here’s what this means for you as a candidate:

* Mistakes in these forms can cost you money, credibility, and even ballot access.

In this simulator, you’ll practice by taking **quizzes that simulate filing errors or compliance checks**.  
 Each correct answer represents signatures earned. Mistakes cost you CC or signatures as filing penalties.”

---

# **Module 5 – July: Campaign Imagery**

---

### **🎯 Purpose**

Develop the **visual identity** of your campaign:

* Logo and color palette

This stage helps voters **recognize and remember your campaign**, reinforcing the message you defined in Module 4\.
