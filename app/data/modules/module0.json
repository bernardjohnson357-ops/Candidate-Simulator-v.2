This simulator will take you through the entire election cycle, one step at a time. You‚Äôll experience the real requirements of filing, fundraising, compliance, and campaigning ‚Äî all safely in a simulation.\"\n\n## How the Simulator Works\n\n**Narrator [neutral]:** \"Here are the ground rules. Think of them as your campaign manual.\"\n\n1. Candidate Coins (CC)\n   - 1 CC = $100 simulated\n   - You start with 50 CC\n   - Earn CC by passing quizzes or completing tasks\n   - Spend CC on campaign needs like filing fees, ads, or communication coaching\n2. Signatures & Voter Approval\n   - Each quiz score = the same number of signatures\n   - 100 signatures = 1% voter approval\n   - Example: scoring 80% on a quiz = 80 signatures = 0.8% approval\n3. Ballot Access\n   - You must qualify for the ballot by paying CC (filing fee) AND gathering enough signatures\n4. Eligibility thresholds:\n   - President ‚Üí 75 CC + 2.5% approval\n   - Senate ‚Üí 50 CC + 2.5% approval\n   - House ‚Üí 31 CC + 2.5% approval\n5. Task Types\n   - Read: Summaries of laws, filing guides, or news\n   - Write: Announcements, strategy documents, responses\n   - Upload: Images (Module 5 ‚Äì signs, T-shirts, bumper stickers)\n   - Speak: Speeches, press conferences, debates (Modules 7+)\n6. Feedback & Progress\n   - After each task, CC, signatures, and approval are updated\n   - Choices carry forward just like a real campaign\n\n## Your First Step\n\n**Narrator [encouraging]:** \"Now it‚Äôs time to make your first campaign decision: which office are you running for? This choice determines how tough the road ahead will be.\"\n\n- üèõ President (75 CC + 2.5% approval)\n- üèõ U.S. Senate (50 CC + 2.5% approval)\n- üèõ U.S. House (31 CC + 2.5% approval)\n\n### Transition After Office Choice\n\n**Narrator [explanatory]:** \"You‚Äôve declared for the [chosen office]. Here‚Äôs what that means:\n- You‚Äôll need [XX CC + 2.5% approval] for this path.\nYou‚Äôre starting with 50 CC and 0% approval. Every quiz and scenario will build your support.\nBefore campaigning, you must file properly. This is where every real candidate begins.\"",
