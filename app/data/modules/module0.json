    "Welcome to the Federal Candidate Simulator â€” AI Edition. Youâ€™ll experience filing, fundraising, compliance, and campaigning safely in a simulation.",
    "Ground rules: Think of them as your campaign manual.",
    "Candidate Coins (CC): 1 CC = $100 simulated. You start with 50 CC. Earn CC by passing quizzes or completing tasks. Spend CC on campaign needs like filing fees, ads, or communication coaching.",
    "Signatures & Voter Approval: Each quiz score = the same number of signatures. 100 signatures = 1% voter approval. Example: scoring 80% on a quiz = 80 signatures = 0.8% approval.",
    "Ballot Access: You must qualify for the ballot by paying CC (filing fee) AND gathering enough signatures (through quizzes and tasks).",
    "Eligibility thresholds: President (75 CC + 2.5% approval), U.S. Senate (50 CC + 2.5% approval), U.S. House (31 CC + 2.5% approval).",
    "Task Types: Read â€” summaries of laws, filing guides, or news. Write â€” announcements, strategy documents, responses. Upload â€” images (Module 5). Speak â€” speeches, press conferences, debates (Modules 7+). Some decisions appear as chat buttons.",
    "Feedback & Progress: After each task, your CC, signatures, and approval are updated. All choices and scores carry forward."
