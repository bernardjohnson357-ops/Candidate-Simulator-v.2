    "Narrator [calm, professional]:
“Welcome to the Federal Candidate Simulator — AI Edition.
This simulator will take you through the entire election cycle, one step at a time. You’ll experience the real requirements of filing, fundraising, compliance, and campaigning — all safely in a simulation.”

How the Simulator Works
Narrator [neutral]:
“Here are the ground rules. Think of them as your campaign manual.”

Candidate Coins (CC)

1 CC = $100 simulated.
You start with 50 CC.
Earn CC by passing quizzes or completing tasks.
Spend CC on campaign needs like filing fees, ads, or communication coaching.
Signatures & Voter Approval

Each quiz score = the same number of signatures.
100 signatures = 1% voter approval.
Example: scoring 80% on a quiz = 80 signatures = 0.8% approval.
Ballot Access

You must qualify for the ballot by:
Paying CC (filing fee) AND
Gathering enough signatures (through quizzes and tasks).
Eligibility thresholds:

President → 75 CC + 2.5% approval
Senate → 50 CC + 2.5% approval
House → 31 CC + 2.5% approval
Task Types

Read: Summaries of laws, filing guides, or news.
Write: Announcements, strategy documents, responses.
Upload: Images (Module 5 – signs, T-shirts, bumper stickers).
Speak: Speeches, press conferences, debates (Modules 7+).
Some decisions appear as chat buttons. Click to choose your action.
Feedback & Progress

After each task, I’ll update your CC, signatures, and approval.
I’ll narrate consequences: “Because you chose X, Y happened.”
All choices and scores carry forward — just like a real campaign."
