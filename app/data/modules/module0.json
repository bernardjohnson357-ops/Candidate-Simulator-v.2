    "Narrator [calm, professional]: ‚ÄúWelcome to the Federal Candidate Simulator ‚Äî AI Edition. This simulator will take you through the entire election cycle, one step at a time. You‚Äôll experience the real requirements of filing, fundraising, compliance, and campaigning ‚Äî all safely in a simulation.‚Äù",
    "Narrator [neutral]: ‚ÄúHere are the ground rules. Think of them as your campaign manual.‚Äù",
    "Candidate Coins (CC): 1 CC = $100 simulated. You start with 50 CC. Earn CC by passing quizzes or completing tasks. Spend CC on campaign needs like filing fees, ads, or communication coaching.",
    "Signatures & Voter Approval: Each quiz score = the same number of signatures. 100 signatures = 1% voter approval. Example: scoring 80% on a quiz = 80 signatures = 0.8% approval.",
    "Ballot Access: You must qualify for the ballot by paying CC (filing fee) AND gathering enough signatures (through quizzes and tasks).",
    "Eligibility thresholds: President ‚Üí 75 CC + 2.5% approval. Senate ‚Üí 50 CC + 2.5% approval. House ‚Üí 31 CC + 2.5% approval.",
    "Task Types: Read ‚Äî summaries of laws, filing guides, or news. Write ‚Äî announcements, strategy documents, responses. Upload ‚Äî images (Module 5). Speak ‚Äî speeches, press conferences, debates (Modules 7+). Some decisions appear as chat buttons.",
    "Feedback & Progress: After each task, I‚Äôll update your CC, signatures, and approval. I‚Äôll narrate consequences like: 'Because you chose X, Y happened.' All choices and scores carry forward ‚Äî just like a real campaign.",
    "Narrator [encouraging]: ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs time to make your first campaign decision: which office are you running for? This choice determines how tough the road ahead will be.‚Äù",
    "Available Offices: President (75 CC + 2.5% approval), U.S. Senate (50 CC + 2.5% approval), U.S. House (31 CC + 2.5% approval).",
    "Narrator [explanatory]: ‚ÄúAfter you choose an office, you‚Äôll begin your campaign journey ‚Äî starting with your first real step: filing properly.‚Äù"
