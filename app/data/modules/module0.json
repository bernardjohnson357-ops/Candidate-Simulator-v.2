You’ll experience the real requirements of filing, fundraising, compliance, and campaigning — all safely in a simulation.”\n\nHow the Simulator Works\nNarrator [neutral]:\n“Here are the ground rules. Think of them as your campaign manual.”\n\nCandidate Coins (CC)\n\n1 CC = $100 simulated.\nYou start with 50 CC.\nEarn CC by passing quizzes or completing tasks.\nSpend CC on campaign needs like filing fees, ads, or communication coaching.\n\nSignatures & Voter Approval\n\nEach quiz score = the same number of signatures.\n100 signatures = 1% voter approval.\nExample: scoring 80% on a quiz = 80 signatures = 0.8% approval.\n\nBallot Access\n\nYou must qualify for the ballot by:\nPaying CC (filing fee) AND\nGathering enough signatures (through quizzes and tasks).\nEligibility thresholds:\nPresident → 75 CC + 2.5% approval\nSenate → 50 CC + 2.5% approval\nHouse → 31 CC + 2.5% approval\n\nTask Types\n\nRead: Summaries of laws, filing guides, or news.\nWrite: Announcements, strategy documents, responses.\nUpload: Images (Module 5 – signs, T-shirts, bumper stickers).\nSpeak: Speeches, press conferences, debates (Modules 7+).\nSome decisions appear as chat buttons. Click to choose your action.\n\nFeedback & Progress\n\nAfter each task, CC, signatures, and approval are updated.\nConsequences are narrated: “Because you chose X, Y happened.”\nAll choices and scores carry forward — just like a real campaign."
