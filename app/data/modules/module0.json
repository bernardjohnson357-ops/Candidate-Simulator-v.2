      "prompt": "Here are the ground rules. Think of them as your campaign manual:\n\n1. Candidate Coins (CC):\n   - 1 CC = $100 simulated.\n   - You start with 50 CC.\n   - Earn CC by passing quizzes or completing tasks.\n   - Spend CC on campaign needs like filing fees, ads, or communication coaching.\n\n2. Signatures & Voter Approval:\n   - Each quiz score = the same number of signatures.\n   - 100 signatures = 1% voter approval.\n   - Example: scoring 80% on a quiz = 80 signatures = 0.8% approval.\n\n3. Ballot Access:\n   - You must qualify for the ballot by paying CC and gathering enough signatures.\n\n4. Eligibility thresholds:\n   - President → 75 CC + 2.5% approval\n   - Senate → 50 CC + 2.5% approval\n   - House → 31 CC + 2.5% approval\n\n5. Task Types:\n   - Read: Summaries of laws, filing guides, or news.\n   - Write: Announcements, strategy documents, responses.\n   - Upload: Images (Module 5 – signs, T-shirts, bumper stickers).\n   - Speak: Speeches, press conferences, debates (Modules 7+).\n   - Some decisions appear as chat buttons.\n\n6. Feedback & Progress:\n   - After each task, CC, signatures, and approval are updated.\n   - All choices and scores carry forward."
