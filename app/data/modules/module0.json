    "Ballot Access: You must qualify for the ballot by paying CC (filing fee) and gathering enough signatures (through quizzes and tasks).",
    "Eligibility thresholds: President → 75 CC + 2.5% approval, Senate → 50 CC + 2.5% approval, House → 31 CC + 2.5% approval.",
    "Task Types: Read, Write, Upload, Speak. Some decisions appear as chat buttons.",
    "Feedback & Progress: After each task, CC, signatures, and approval are updated. All choices and scores carry forward."
