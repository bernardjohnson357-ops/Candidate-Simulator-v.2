  "narrator": "As a Libertarian candidate, you must first secure your party’s nomination and then file with the Secretary of State. You may pay the filing fee with Candidate Coins, or — in the real world — you could instead collect signatures to appear on the ballot.",

  "readingSummary": [
    "Party Nomination: Libertarians hold conventions; Democrats and Republicans hold primaries. Candidates must secure nomination before filing.",
    "State Filing: Nominees file with the Secretary of State (SOS), either paying a fee (using CC in the simulator) or collecting signatures. Deadlines often fall in December before the election year. Signature rules mirror independents — voters cannot have participated in another party’s primary.",
    "Federal Filing: After state paperwork, federal compliance begins. Candidates must file FEC Form 1 (Statement of Organization) and Form 2 (Statement of Candidacy).",
    "Record-Keeping: Accurate filings are crucial. Mistakes reduce CC and credibility; mastery earns signatures and boosts approval."
