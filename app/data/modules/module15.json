    "Narrator [softer tone]: “Whether you won the seat, influenced the race, or stood as a symbolic voice, your journey reflects the real challenges every candidate faces. Every endorsement weighed, every voter conversation, every moment of pressure under the lights mattered.”",
    "Narrator [uplifting tone]: “As you leave this simulator, consider the deeper purpose: campaigns are about people, principles, and persistence. In the end, the measure of leadership is not only counted in votes, but in the strength of your message and the trust you earn.”",
    "Narrator [closing]: “Thank you for participating in the Federal Candidate Simulator. Your campaign is complete… but your political journey has only just begun.”"
