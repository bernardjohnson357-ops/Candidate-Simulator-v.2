Module 0 – Introduction

Federal Build for the Candidate Simulator


---

Purpose

The Candidate Simulator is designed to educate prospective candidates—especially independents and third-party hopefuls—by providing structured, realistic campaign practice. It combines both simulation mechanics (Candidate Coins, signatures, quizzes) and real-world references (laws, filing requirements, official guides).

Participants will engage in:

Reading → Understand campaign requirements, legal frameworks, and processes.

Writing → Develop and refine campaign positions.

Voice interactions → Practice candidate communication skills.

Record-keeping → Track actions consistently across modules.



---

Candidate Coin (CC) System (Simulation Mechanics)

1 Candidate Coin (CC) = $100 USD (simulated value)

Quizzes simulate fundraising → correct answers generate CC.

Signatures simulate voter approval:

1 signature = 0.0001 voter approval

Example: 1,000 signatures = 10% approval



Eligibility for General Election (before Module 3):

At least 1% voter approval

Filing fee (in CC) must be paid



---

Filing Fees (Simulation Equivalents)

President of the United States → 75 CC

U.S. Senate → 50 CC

U.S. House of Representatives → 31 CC


Ballot Access in Lieu of Filing Fee:

President → 25% voter approval (nationwide threshold)

Senate → 14% voter approval (statewide threshold)

House → 7% voter approval (district threshold)



---

Quizzes & Scoring (Simulation Mechanics)

Mix of multiple-choice and open-ended questions.

80%+ score → signatures earned equal to % score + 1 CC.

100% score → 100 signatures + 2 CC.


Quarterly FEC Filing Quizzes (simulation task triggered by 50+ CC spent):

Covers both Form 3 compliance and simulator expenditures/CC totals.

Penalties for mistakes:

Incorrect multiple-choice = –1 CC

Incorrect open-ended = –50 signatures


Feedback is delayed until the next module.


Amendments:

Users may reattempt incorrect questions without penalty.

If incorrect again → penalties are doubled, applied as an “FEC administrative fee for penalties and errors.”
