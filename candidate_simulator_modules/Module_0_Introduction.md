# **Module 0 – Introduction**

**Federal Candidate Simulator – AI Edition**

---

## **🎯 Purpose**

The Candidate Simulator teaches prospective federal candidates—especially independents and third-party hopefuls—how to run a campaign safely and realistically.

It combines:

* **Real-World Processes:** Laws, FEC filing requirements, ballot access, and official guides.  
* **Simulation Mechanics:** Candidate Coins (CC), quizzes, voter signatures, and scenario-based decision-making.

By the end, participants understand both what real candidates must do and how to practice these steps in a simulation.

## **🏛️ The Real Candidate Process**

Running for federal office in the U.S. involves:

1. **Choosing an Office:** President, U.S. Senate, or U.S. House.  
2. **Meeting Ballot Requirements:** Paying fees or gathering signatures.  
3. **FEC Reporting:** Filing quarterly once campaign activity crosses financial thresholds.  
4. **Building Voter Support:** Developing a campaign identity and gaining approval.

## **🎮 How the Simulator Works**

### **Starting Conditions**

### **Candidate Coin (CC) System**

* **1 CC \= $100 (simulated)**  
* Quizzes simulate fundraising: correct answers earn CC and signatures.

**Scoring Example:**

* 80%+ → % of signatures \+ 1 CC  
* 100% → 100 signatures \+ 2 CC

---

### **Signatures → Voter Approval**

* **1 signature \= 0.0001 voter approval**  
* Example: 100 signatures \= 1% approval; 1,000 signatures \= 10% approval.
