    "brief": "Candidates learn about Candidate Coins (CC), signatures, voter approval, and ballot eligibility. They choose whether to run for President, Senate, or House.",
    "detailed": "This module serves as the campaign “boot camp.” Players are introduced to the simulator’s scoring system (CC = campaign funds, signatures = grassroots support, voter approval = polling). The AI explains task types (read, write, upload, speak, or button-choice) and how each affects campaign performance. Candidates declare for President, Senate, or House — each with different thresholds for CC and signatures. This decision determines the difficulty of the road ahead.",

They can either pay the filing fee or collect valid signatures (from voters who didn’t vote in another party’s primary). Deadlines differ: independents must file by May, write-ins by August. Candidates learn about disqualification risks, such as missing deadlines or submitting invalid petitions. In the simulator, filing mistakes cost CC, while high quiz performance earns signatures and voter approval. This establishes the first real 'make or break' decision for their campaign.",

After nomination, they must still file with the SOS, choosing between a filing fee or signature path. Deadlines usually occur in December before the election year. Signature rules mirror independents (voters cannot have voted in another primary).

This requires filing Form 1 (Statement of Candidacy) and Form 2 (Statement of Organization) within 15 days. Form 2 requires naming a treasurer and providing banking info. Errors in these filings in real life result in penalties; in the simulator, they cost signatures or CC. Quiz questions simulate filing errors or missing deadlines.
