🗳 Module 0 – Orientation & Introduction

Narrator [calm, professional]:
 “Welcome to the Federal Candidate Simulator — AI Edition.
 This simulator will take you through the entire election cycle, one step at a time. You’ll experience the real requirements of filing, fundraising, compliance, and campaigning — all safely in a simulation.”

How the Simulator Works
Narrator [neutral]:
 “Here are the ground rules. Think of them as your campaign manual.”
Candidate Coins (CC)


1 CC = $100 simulated.
You start with 50 CC.
Earn CC by passing quizzes or completing tasks.
Spend CC on campaign needs like filing fees, ads, or communication coaching.
Signatures & Voter Approval


Each quiz score = the same number of signatures.
100 signatures = 1% voter approval.
Example: scoring 80% on a quiz = 80 signatures = 0.8% approval.
Ballot Access


You must qualify for the ballot by:
Paying CC (filing fee) AND
Gathering enough signatures (through quizzes and tasks).
Eligibility thresholds:


President → 75 CC + 2.5% approval
Senate → 50 CC + 2.5% approval 
House → 31 CC + 2.5% approval
Task Types


Read: Summaries of laws, filing guides, or news.
Write: Announcements, strategy documents, responses.
Upload: Images (Module 5 – signs, T-shirts, bumper stickers).
Speak: Speeches, press conferences, debates (Modules 7+).
Some decisions appear as chat buttons. Click to choose your action.
Feedback & Progress


After each task, I’ll update your CC, signatures, and approval.
I’ll narrate consequences: “Because you chose X, Y happened.”
All choices and scores carry forward — just like a real campaign.

Your First Step
Narrator [encouraging]:
 “Now it’s time to make your first campaign decision: which office are you running for?
 This choice determines how tough the road ahead will be.”
[User types the office into the chat]
🏛 President (75 CC + 2.5% approval)
🏛 U.S. Senate (50 CC + 2.5% approval)
🏛 U.S. House (31 CC + 2.5% approval)

Transition After Office Choice
Narrator [explanatory]:
 “You’ve declared for the [chosen office].
 Here’s what that means:
You’ll need [XX CC + 2.5% approval] for this path.
You’re starting with 50 CC and 0% approval. Every quiz and scenario will build your support.
Now, before you can even think about campaigning, you must file properly. This is where every real candidate begins.”

Module 1 – Filing Phase

Narrator [neutral]:
 “In the real-world, you have two possible paths: Independent/Write-In or Party candidate. However, for the purpose of this simulator, the filing process is different, allowing only party filing, along with paying the fees.
🗳 Party Candidate (Module 1)

Module 1 – Party Filing
Narrator [serious]:
 “As a party candidate, you must be nominated through your party and also file with the Secretary of State (SOS). Within this simulation, you must:
Pay the filing fee AND
Gather signatures (to simulate convention votes).
Then you’ll move into federal compliance through the FEC.”
Narrator [neutral]:
 “Next, I’ll give you a reading summary of the Texas SOS Party Candidate Guide. Then, you’ll take a short quiz. Your score will convert into signatures.”

Module 1 – Party Filing

Narrator [serious]:
 “As a Party Candidate, your filing process starts with the Texas Secretary of State (SOS) and your party’s nomination process. This is your first big step toward ballot access.”

📝 Reading Summary
(Adapted from the Texas SOS Party Candidate Guide)
Narrator [neutral, instructive]:
 “To appear on the ballot as a Party Candidate in Texas, you must:
Be nominated by your party through conventions (Libertarian, Green, etc.) or a primary (Democratic, Republican).
File an Application of Candidacy with the Texas Secretary of State.
Choose one qualification method:
Pay the required filing fee, OR
Submit the required petition signatures.
Deadlines:
Party candidates must file their paperwork by December of the year before the election.
Petition signatures are due at the same time.
Signature rules:
Signatures must be from registered voters who did not vote in another party’s primary.
Petition sheets must be submitted with a sworn affidavit.”

Detailed Summary (AI Explanation)
Narrator [calm, explanatory]:
 “Here’s what this means for you as a party candidate:
You must go through your party first — conventions or primaries decide who advances to the general election ballot.
Even after winning a nomination, you must file with the SOS and either pay the filing fee or submit signatures.
If you choose signatures, you’re limited to voters who didn’t already participate in another party’s primary.
In real life, a mistake here disqualifies you. In the simulator, mistakes will cost you CC or signatures.”

📊 Quiz – Party Candidate Filing
Narrator [serious]:
 “Let’s test your understanding. Answer carefully: your score equals signatures earned.
Each correct answer = +20 signatures.
 Each wrong answer = –1 CC (filing mistake penalty).
 Score ≥ 80% = +1 bonus CC.
 Score = 100% = +2 bonus CC.”

Narrator [serious]: “Your state-level filing is complete. But state approval isn’t enough — every federal candidate must also register with the FEC. That’s where we go next: Module 2 — Federal Compliance, starting with Forms 1 and 2.”

🗳 Module 2 – Party FEC Filing Fee Quizzes
Narrator [calm, professional]:
 “Now that you’ve completed your state-level party filing, your next responsibility is federal compliance with the FEC. Every candidate — Independent, third-party, or major-party — must follow the same federal rules once campaign activity begins.”

📝 Reading Summary
(Adapted from FEC Candidate Guide, Forms 1 & 2)
Narrator [neutral, instructive]:
 “As a Party Candidate, you must file two forms with the Federal Election Commission once you raise or spend over $5,000 in campaign funds:”
FEC Form 1 – Statement of Candidacy


Officially declares you as a candidate.
Establishes your candidacy with the FEC.
FEC Form 2 – Statement of Organization


Registers your principal campaign committee.
Requires your treasurer’s name, address, and bank account details.
Important Rules:
Both forms must be filed within 15 days of crossing the $5,000 threshold.
Once filed, you must begin quarterly reports (Form 3) to track contributions and expenditures.
Mistakes or late filings can result in FEC fines and loss of credibility.

Detailed Summary (AI Explanation)
Narrator [calm, explanatory]:
 “As a Party Candidate, your federal filing process is nearly identical to Independents. Key points to remember:”
You’ve already been nominated by your party, but the FEC still requires you to be officially registered as a federal candidate.
The $5,000 threshold applies no matter what — even if your party provides initial funding.
Form 1 declares your candidacy.
Form 2 registers your campaign committee and treasurer.
From here on, you’ll need to carefully track and report all campaign finances.

📊 Quiz – FEC Forms 1 & 2 (Party Candidates)
Narrator [serious]:
 “Let’s test your understanding. Your score translates directly into signatures earned:”
Each correct answer = +20 signatures
Each wrong answer = –50 signatures (simulated FEC penalty)
Score ≥ 80% = +1 CC bonus
Score = 100% = +2 CC bonus
