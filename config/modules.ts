    content: `Narrator [calm, professional]: "Welcome to the Federal Candidate Simulator ‚Äî AI Edition. 
This simulator will take you through the entire election cycle, one step at a time. 
You‚Äôll experience the real requirements of filing, fundraising, compliance, and campaigning ‚Äî all safely in a simulation."

Narrator [neutral]: "Here are the ground rules. Think of them as your campaign manual."

Candidate Coins (CC):
- 1 CC = $100 simulated.
- You start with 50 CC.
- Earn CC by passing quizzes or completing tasks.
- Spend CC on campaign needs like filing fees, ads, or communication coaching.

Signatures & Voter Approval:
- Each quiz score = the same number of signatures.
- 100 signatures = 1% voter approval.
- Example: scoring 80% on a quiz = 80 signatures = 0.8% approval.

Ballot Access:
- You must qualify for the ballot by paying CC (filing fee) AND gathering enough signatures (through quizzes and tasks).

Eligibility thresholds:
- President ‚Üí 75 CC + 2.5% approval
- Senate ‚Üí 50 CC + 2.5% approval
- House ‚Üí 31 CC + 2.5% approval

Task Types:
- Read: Summaries of laws, filing guides, or news.
- Write: Announcements, strategy documents, responses.
- Upload: Images (Module 5 ‚Äì signs, T-shirts, bumper stickers).
- Speak: Speeches, press conferences, debates (Modules 7+).
- Some decisions appear as chat buttons. Click to choose your action.

Feedback & Progress:
- After each task, your CC, signatures, and approval will be updated.
- Narration explains consequences: "Because you chose X, Y happened."
- Choices and scores carry forward like a real campaign.`,
