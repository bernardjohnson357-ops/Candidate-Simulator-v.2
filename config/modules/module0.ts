**Narrator [calm, professional]:** ‚ÄúWelcome to the Federal Candidate Simulator ‚Äî AI Edition. This simulator will take you through the entire election cycle, one step at a time. You‚Äôll experience the real requirements of filing, fundraising, compliance, and campaigning ‚Äî all safely in a simulation.‚Äù

## How the Simulator Works
1. Candidate Coins (CC)
   - 1 CC = $100 simulated.
   - Start with 50 CC.
   - Earn CC by passing quizzes or completing tasks.
   - Spend CC on campaign needs like filing fees, ads, or communication coaching.

2. Signatures & Voter Approval
   - Each quiz score = same number of signatures.
   - 100 signatures = 1% approval.
   - Example: scoring 80% on a quiz = 80 signatures = 0.8% approval.

3. Ballot Access
   - Pay CC (filing fee) AND gather enough signatures.

4. Eligibility thresholds:
   - President ‚Üí 75 CC + 2.5% approval
   - Senate ‚Üí 50 CC + 2.5% approval
   - House ‚Üí 31 CC + 2.5% approval

5. Task Types
   - Read, Write, Speak, Upload

6. Feedback & Progress
   - After each task, CC, signatures, and approval are updated.
