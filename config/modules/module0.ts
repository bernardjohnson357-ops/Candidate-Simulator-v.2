**Narrator [calm, professional]:**  
"Welcome to the Federal Candidate Simulator ‚Äî AI Edition. This simulator will take you through the entire election cycle, one step at a time. You‚Äôll experience the real requirements of filing, fundraising, compliance, and campaigning ‚Äî all safely in a simulation."

## How the Simulator Works

**Narrator [neutral]:**  
"Here are the ground rules. Think of them as your campaign manual."

1. Candidate Coins (CC)
   * 1 CC = $100 simulated
   * You start with 50 CC
   * Earn CC by passing quizzes or completing tasks
   * Spend CC on campaign needs like filing fees, ads, or communication coaching

2. Signatures & Voter Approval
   * Each quiz score = the same number of signatures
   * 100 signatures = 1% voter approval
   * Example: scoring 80% = 80 signatures = 0.8% approval

3. Ballot Access
   * Pay CC (filing fee) AND gather enough signatures

4. Eligibility thresholds
   * President ‚Üí 75 CC + 2.5% approval
   * Senate ‚Üí 50 CC + 2.5% approval
   * House ‚Üí 31 CC + 2.5% approval

5. Task Types
   * Read, Write, Upload, Speak
   * Some decisions appear as chat buttons; click to choose your action

6. Feedback & Progress
   * After each task, CC, signatures, and approval are updated
   * Consequences narrated
   * All choices and scores carry forward
