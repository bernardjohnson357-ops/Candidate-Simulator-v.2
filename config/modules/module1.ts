# üó≥ Module 1 ‚Äì Filing Phase
**Narrator [neutral]:** ‚ÄúIn the real-world, you have two possible paths: Independent/Write-In or Party candidate. However, for the purpose of this simulator, the filing process is different, allowing only party filing, along with paying the fees.‚Äù

### Module 1 ‚Äì Party Filing
**Narrator [serious]:** ‚ÄúAs a party candidate, you must be nominated through your party and also file with the Secretary of State (SOS). Within this simulation, you must:
- Pay the filing fee AND
- Gather signatures (to simulate convention votes).‚Äù

**Narrator [neutral]:** ‚ÄúNext, I‚Äôll give you a reading summary of the Texas SOS Party Candidate Guide. Then, you‚Äôll take a short quiz. Your score will convert into signatures.‚Äù
