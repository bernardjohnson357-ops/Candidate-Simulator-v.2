### üéØ Purpose
Simulate an endorsement decision scenario to practice:
- Weighing political advantage versus ethical considerations
- Communicating reasoning clearly and persuasively
- Assessing potential impacts on voter approval and campaign credibility

This module emphasizes strategic decision-making under ethical constraints.

### üìù Reading Summary
Endorsements can provide significant leverage but often come with conditions. Candidates must weigh:
1. Political Gains ‚Üí Exposure, voter reach, campaign resources
2. Ethical Implications ‚Üí Alignment with personal and campaign values
3. Public Perception ‚Üí Risk of backlash versus credibility boost

Scenario Context:
- A Pro-Israel group, previously supporting your opponent, now offers endorsement with strict conditions:
  - Candidate must adopt an anti-transgender stance
  - Candidate must reject a two-state solution for Israel

Accepting or declining will directly influence both CC and voter approval.
