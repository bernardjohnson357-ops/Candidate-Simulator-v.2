# **Candidate Simulator Federal Master Roadmap**

### **🗳 Orientation**

Welcome to the **Candidate Simulator** — a training environment designed to prepare you for the realities of running for federal office. Each stage is scaffolded, meaning you’ll **read**, then **write**, then **speak** in sequence.

#### **Why Scaffolded?**

Too often, campaigns rely on surface-level talking points. This simulator emphasizes depth:

1. **Read** → Absorb rules, guides, and case studies.  
2. **Write** → Organize your thinking and commit ideas to text.  
3. **Speak** → Deliver your message with clarity and impact.

This step-by-step process builds the discipline serious candidates need.

---

#### **Candidate Coins (CC)**

* **1 CC \= $100 simulated campaign funds**  
* **Earn CC** by passing quizzes and completing assignments.  
* **Spend CC** on campaign resources or communication coaching:  
  * Upload \+ Review (10 CC): Structured feedback on drafts.  
  * Revision Suggestions (15 CC): Guidance on clarity and tone.  
  * Delivery Hints (20 CC): Pacing and communication coaching.

  ---

  #### **Scoring System**

* **Quizzes → Signatures**: Your score equals signatures earned (e.g., 80% \= 80 signatures).  
* **Signature Conversion**: 100 signatures \= 1% voter approval.  
* **Bonus Coins**:  
  * ≥80% score \= \+1 CC  
  * 100% score \= \+2 CC  
* **Penalties**:  
  * Wrong multiple-choice \= –1 CC  
  * Wrong open-ended \= –50 signatures  
  * Retake mistakes \= double penalties (“FEC administrative fees”).

The AI will never give political advice—only feedback on clarity, structure, and effectiveness.

---

#### **Key Rule**

* Reading tasks → you must read.  
* Writing tasks → you must type.  
* Speaking tasks → you must use voice input.

This ensures you practice thinking before persuading.

# **Module 0 – Introduction**

**Federal Candidate Simulator – AI Edition**

## **🎯 Purpose**

The Candidate Simulator teaches prospective candidates—especially independents and third-party hopefuls—how to navigate campaigns safely and realistically.

It combines:

* **Real Processes**: Laws, FEC filing requirements, ballot access, and official guides.  
* **Simulation Mechanics**: Candidate Coins, quizzes, voter signatures, and scenario-based decision-making.

By the end, you’ll understand what real candidates must do and how to practice those steps in a controlled simulation.

---

## **🏛️ The Real Candidate Process**

Running for federal office involves:

1. Choosing an office (President, Senate, or House).  
2. Meeting ballot requirements (fees or signatures).  
3. Filing FEC reports once spending/receipts cross thresholds.  
4. Building voter support through campaign identity and approval.

*Sources: FEC Candidate Guide (2024 edition); State Filing Guides*

---

## **🎮 How the Simulator Works**

### **Starting Conditions**

* Begin with **50 CC**.  
* Choose a ballot access path (e.g., Libertarian nomination).

  ### **Candidate Coins**

* 1 CC \= $100 simulated.  
* Quizzes \= fundraising: correct answers earn CC and signatures.

**Scoring Example**:

* ≥80% → Signatures \+ 1 CC  
* 100% → 100 signatures \+ 2 CC

  ### **Signatures → Approval**

* 100 signatures \= 1% voter approval  
* 1,000 signatures \= 10% voter approval

  ### **Eligibility for General Election**

| Office | Fee (CC) | Minimum Approval |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| President | 75 CC | 2.5% |
| Senate | 50 CC | 2.5% |
| House | 31 CC | 2.5% |

  ### **Quizzes & Retakes**

* All quizzes: 1 retake allowed without penalty.  
* **Form 3 quizzes (FEC filings)** appear after spending 50+ CC.  
* Penalties:  
  * Wrong multiple-choice \= –1 CC  
  * Wrong open-ended \= –50 signatures  
  * Retake errors \= double penalty

# **Libertarian Federal Candidate Simulator**

**Narrator:** “Welcome to the *Libertarian Federal Candidate Simulator.* Over the next several modules, you will experience a full federal campaign — from filing to fundraising, compliance, messaging, and outreach — all in a safe, educational environment.”

**Narrator:** “You begin with **50 Candidate Coins (CC)**, **0 signatures**, and **0% voter approval.** Every decision you make will affect these metrics, which represent your campaign resources, grassroots support, and voter trust.”

**Prompt:** “First, type which office you want to run for: **President, Senate, or House.** Consider the thresholds for ballot access. For example, President requires **75 CC and 2.5% approval**, or the equivalent in nationwide signatures.”

*(Wait for user input. Narrate result.)*

**Narrator (example):** “Great choice\! Running for the Senate will require **50 CC** and **2.5% approval** from statewide signatures. Let’s move forward to the filing stage.”

---

## **Module 1 – Filing Phase**

🎯 **Purpose**  
 Teach filing requirements for party candidates at both the **state** and **federal** levels.

📝 **Brief Summary**  
 Party candidates must secure their party’s nomination, file with the state, and prepare for federal compliance. Quiz performance converts into signatures and CC bonuses.

📖 **Detailed Summary**

* **Party Nomination**: Libertarians hold conventions; Democrats and Republicans hold primaries. Candidates must secure nomination before filing.  
* **State Filing**: Nominees file with the Secretary of State (SOS), either paying a fee (using CC in the simulator) or collecting signatures. Deadlines often fall in December before the election year. Signature rules mirror independents — voters cannot have participated in another party’s primary.  
* **Federal Filing**: After state paperwork, federal compliance begins. Candidates must file **FEC Form 1 (Statement of Organization)** and **Form 2 (Statement of Candidacy).**  
* **Record-Keeping**: Accurate filings are crucial. Mistakes reduce CC and credibility; mastery earns signatures and boosts approval.

📝 **Task**

* Complete a quiz on **state filing requirements** (Texas SOS) and **basic federal filings (FEC Forms 1 & 2).**

---

**Narrator:** “As a Libertarian candidate, you must first secure your party’s nomination and then file with the Secretary of State. You may pay the filing fee with Candidate Coins, or — in the real world — you could instead collect signatures to appear on the ballot.”

**Objectives:**

* Learn filing deadlines and nomination rules.  
* Understand trade-offs between paying filing fees and gathering signatures.

**Chat Flow:**  
 “Describe how you plan to secure your nomination and meet filing requirements. Based on your plan, I’ll narrate the impact on your **CC, signatures, and voter approval.**”

**Narrator \[serious\]:** “As a party candidate, nomination alone is not enough. You must also file with the Secretary of State. Like independents, you can pay a filing fee (using simulator CC) or pursue signatures. Then, you’ll move into federal compliance with the FEC.”

**Narrator \[neutral\]:** “Next, I’ll provide a reading summary of the Texas SOS Party Candidate Guide. Afterwards, you’ll take a short quiz. Your score will convert into signatures.”

---

## **Module 2 – FEC Filing Quizzes (Party)**

**🎯 Purpose**  
 Test and practice federal filing requirements for party candidates, focusing on **FEC Forms 1 and 2\.**

**📝 Brief Summary**  
 Once a campaign raises or spends over $5,000, candidates must file **Form 1 (Statement of Candidacy) and Form 2 (Statement of Organization).** This module uses quizzes to simulate those requirements. Correct answers reward **Candidate Coins (CC)** and **signatures**; mistakes simulate costly compliance errors.

**📖 Detailed Summary**

* **Threshold:** Party candidates follow the same federal rules as independents. Crossing the **$5,000 fundraising/spending threshold** triggers federal filing obligations.  
* **Forms Required:**  
  * **Form 1 (Statement of Candidacy)** – formally declares a candidate.  
  * **Form 2 (Statement of Organization)** – registers the campaign committee.  
* **Reporting**: After filing, candidates must begin **quarterly reports (Form 3\)** to disclose contributions and expenditures.  
* **Simulation Mechanics:**  
  * Quiz questions test deadlines, form content, and reporting rules.  
  * Correct answers \= signatures \+ CC.  
  * Errors \= loss of CC/signatures, representing fines or credibility hits.

This module reinforces that **party nomination does not exempt candidates from federal compliance** — *all candidates must follow FEC rules.*

**📝 Task**

* Complete multiple rounds of quizzes covering **Forms 1 and 2\.**  
* Outcome: Earn **Candidate Coins (CC)** and **voter signatures.**  
* Completion unlocks entry into the **General Election branch**.

---

Narrator: “Once you raise or spend over $5,000, federal law requires you to file **Form 1 (Statement of Candidacy)** and **Form 2 (Statement of Organization).** This ensures transparency in campaign finances.”

**Objectives:**

* Understand the federal filing process.  
* Learn how errors or delays affect your campaign.

Chat Flow:  
 “I’ll quiz you on key FEC rules. Correct answers earn **signatures** and **Candidate Coins.** Mistakes simulate real-world penalties. Let’s begin: you’ve just raised **$6,000** — what’s your next step?”

---

**✅ Next Step:** Completing **Modules 1 and 2** unlocks the **General Election branch**, where you’ll manage campaign spending, team building, opposition research, and scenario-based exercises.

## **Module 12 – October 31: Television Interview**

🎯 **Purpose**  
 Simulate a live televised interview to test composure, adaptability, and message discipline under high-pressure media questioning.

📝 **Brief Summary**  
 Candidates take part in a multi-phase TV-style interview (softball opening → policy questions → tougher “press” / gotcha phase → closing challenge). The AI evaluates concision, credibility, and persuasive clarity. Strong performances raise voter approval and momentum; weak or skipped answers lower trust.

📖 **Detailed Summary**  
 Televised interviews are pivotal: they reveal how a candidate handles escalation from light conversation to sharp policy scrutiny. This module recreates that arc in four phases so you can practice staying on-message while responding to unexpected pressure.

* **Activity 1 – Softball Opening (Text/Voice Response)**  
   Warm-up questions (local color, school visit highlights, light human-interest topics). Purpose: open on a calm, likable note and demonstrate composure.

* **Activity 2 – Policy Questions (Text/Voice Response)**  
   Direct policy queries on topics relevant to your campaign (e.g., community safety, education policy, fiscal responsibility, and foreign affairs). Purpose: show evidence-based answers, clear principles, and concise policy framing.

* **Activity 3 – “Press / Gotcha” Phase (Text/Voice Response)**  
   Tougher, rapid follow-ups that press for contradictions, ask for specifics on opponent’s record, or raise recent controversies (fraud/funding/ethics). Purpose: practice bridging, accountability, and pivoting without losing clarity.

* **Activity 4 – Closing Challenge (Text/Voice Response)**  
   Final question: would you repeat key statements in a face-to-face debate or stand by a controversial position? Purpose: practice a decisive, principled close that voters can remember.

📝 **Task**

* Participate in all four interview phases (type or use voice input).  
* Keep answers concise (preferably one short paragraph or 20–45 seconds if spoken), on-message, and respectful.  
* Use bridging techniques when necessary (acknowledge → pivot → answer).  
* Avoid evasiveness; demonstrate accountability and voter-focused framing.

📊 **Outcome**

* AI scores and narrates effects on **voter approval**, **Candidate Coins (CC)** (if missteps incur simulated penalties), and **campaign momentum**.  
* Immediate feedback on clarity, factual framing, and persuasive strength.  
* Saved sample answers (for later review, debate prep, or final-week messaging).

🎙️ **Narrator**  
 “You’re live on air. Begin with a calm opening, stay concise during policy questions, withstand the pressure of the gotcha phase, and close with a memorable, principled statement.”

🎯 **Objectives**

* Demonstrate poise and clarity under live media pressure.  
* Answer complex questions concisely and honestly.  
* Close with a strong, repeatable message voters can recall.

💬 **Chat Flow**  
 “Start the interview whenever you’re ready. I’ll cue the phases and evaluate each response in real time, narrating how the audience and media react, and how your CC and approval change.”

## **Module 13 – November 1: Pro-Israel Group Meeting**

🎯 **Purpose** Test the candidate’s ability to navigate high-stakes endorsement offers that involve political and ethical trade-offs.

📝 **Brief Summary** A Pro-Israel group offers conditional support, previously backing the opponent. Candidates must decide whether to accept or decline the endorsement, balancing potential campaign gains against moral credibility and voter trust.

📖 **Detailed Summary**  
 Endorsements are a double-edged sword: they can bring legitimacy, funding, and momentum, but often with conditions that may alienate certain voters. In this module, a Pro-Israel group approaches the candidate with an offer of significant resources and public support. However, the endorsement is tied to two controversial conditions:

1. Adopting an anti-transgender policy stance.  
2. Rejecting a two-state solution for Israel.

The candidate faces a difficult choice:

* **Accept** → Gain \+1000 CC and an advertising boost, but risk public protests and backlash.  
* **Decline** → Preserve credibility and moral standing, though at the cost of immediate campaign advantages.

This scenario emphasizes the complexity of weighing political gain against ethical consistency and long-term voter approval.

📝 **Task**

* Participate in a voiced AI dialogue.  
* Decide whether to accept or decline the endorsement.  
* If prompted, explain reasoning behind the choice.

📊 **Outcome**

* CC, voter approval, and credibility adjust depending on the decision.  
* A strong performance demonstrates the ability to weigh short-term gains against long-term political and ethical considerations.

📝 **Brief Summary** Candidates participate in the final debate, delivering an opening statement and responding to 20–25 policy questions from an AI moderator and opponent, with live audience reactions and real-time fact-checks.

📖 **Detailed Summary**  
 The debate is the centerpiece of the campaign and a defining moment before Election Day. Candidates begin with a concise opening statement, then face a rigorous series of 20–25 questions spanning the economy, foreign policy, social issues, and local concerns.

Key features of this simulation include:

* **AI Moderator \+ Opponent** → Pose questions, press challenges, and highlight contrasts.  
* **Live Audience Reactions** → Applause, cheers, or jeers simulate voter response.  
* **Real-Time Fact Checks** → Moderator verifies statements against prior module responses and candidate positions.

Candidates must demonstrate consistency, composure, and persuasiveness while managing tough policy questions and rapid-fire challenges. Strong performances can swing undecided voters, while weak or evasive answers may erode approval.

📝 **Task**

* Deliver an opening statement (typed or spoken).  
* Participate in the AI-moderated debate.  
* Respond to all 20–25 questions, adapting to fact-checks and audience reactions.

📊 **Outcome**

  ## **Module 15 – Final Summary (Post-Debate)**

🎯 **Purpose** Provide closure to the simulator by reflecting on strategies, key decisions, and final campaign outcomes.

📝 **Brief Summary** Candidates receive a comprehensive wrap-up of their campaign journey. The AI compiles stats, highlights strengths and weaknesses, and delivers a tailored narrative that ties actions and choices to electoral results.

📖 **Detailed Summary**  
 This module closes the campaign simulator. After the debate, the AI calculates the candidate’s final stats and provides a personalized summary.

Key components include:

* **Final Stats** → Candidate Coins (CC), signatures, voter approval, and major spending decisions.  
* **Path Taken** → Independent or party route, endorsements, petitions, debates, and strategic turning points.  
* **Strengths** → Clear messaging, moral stance, fundraising success, or strong debate performance.  
* **Weaknesses** → Missed opportunities, inconsistent responses, controversial positions, or failed endorsements.  
* **Outcome Based on Voter Approval**:  
  * Victory → Above 50% (elected to office)  
  * Competitive Candidate → 35–49% (credible, strong showing short of victory)  
  * Spoiler Role → 20–34% (influenced race but not competitive)  
  * Symbolic Voice → Below 20% (low support, message-focused)

The AI then delivers a closing narrative that highlights the campaign’s defining moments, the candidate’s performance under pressure, and lessons learned for real-world political engagement.

📝 **Task**

* Reflect on your campaign journey.  
* Review AI-generated stats and narrative summary.  
* Consider lessons for future strategy and constituent engagement.

📊 **Outcome**

* Consolidated campaign results with final CC, approval, and key decisions.  
* Narrative closure that reinforces how simulation choices translate into electoral consequences.
